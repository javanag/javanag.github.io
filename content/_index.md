# Howdy, I'm Javan and I am a <br> software developer.
<br>
After recently graduating, I've been working as a developer in the logistics domain. Before this, I completed internships in fintech, networking, and ecommerce, along with a few brief experiences in freelance work.

I took up programming as a kid. Inspired by playing [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us "You know what this is"), I wanted to [know how it was made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BES9EKK4Aw4 "YouTube video of the creator playing around in debug mode"). In the free time that I have, I lift weights, watch anime, play basketball, lerne Deutsch, and try to learn new things each day in order to improve my life, in that order (*not an exhaustive list).

Look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/javanag), and talk to me (about anything) at [contact@javangraham.com](mailto:contact@javangraham.com?subject=Howdy!&body=Hi%20Javan%2C%20your%20home%20page%20was%20so%20inspirational%20that%20I%20just%20had%20to%20reach%20out.). While you're here, check out what I [write]({{< ref "/posts" >}} "You will learn a lot, I promise") and what I [make]({{< ref "/projects" >}} "Hint: it won't be food").
