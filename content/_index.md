<h1>Howdy, I'm <strong>Javan</strong> and I am <span id="motd-article">a&nbsp;</span><br id="motd-break"><strong id="motd">software developer</strong>.</h1><br>

<script src="/js/motd.js"></script> 

These days I'm focused on building [Anishare](https://anishare.co), an online collaborative social animation platform.

In the past, I worked as a software developer in [freight](https://www.flexport.com/products/trucking/). In the more distant past while attending [{{< fa fa-solid fa-building-columns >}} university](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/), I completed internships at fintech, [networking](https://bluecatnetworks.com/), and [ecommerce](https://www.shopify.com/) companies, along with a few brief experiences in freelance work.

I took up programming as a kid. Inspired by playing [{{< fa fa-solid fa-gamepad >}} Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us "You know what this is"), I wanted to [know how it was made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BES9EKK4Aw4 "YouTube video of the creator playing around in debug mode") and learn to create equally captivating digital experiences one day. To discover more about me and what I do in my free time, start clicking "software developer" above for an almost exhaustive list<noscript>... **actually, you'll need to enable JavaScript for that experience**</noscript>.
