# Howdy, I'm **Javan** and I am a <br> **software developer**. 
<br>

After recently graduating {{< fa fa-solid fa-user-graduate >}}, I've been working as a developer in [logistics/freight {{< fa fa-solid fa-truck >}}](https://news.shopify.com/oh-ship-shopify-to-acquire-deliverr-for-21b-building-the-future-of-global-logistics-for-independent-brands#). Before this, I completed internships in fintech {{< fa fa-solid fa-money-bill-trend-up >}}, networking {{< fa fa-solid fa-circle-nodes >}}, and ecommerce {{< fa fa-solid fa-cart-shopping >}}, along with a few brief experiences in freelance work {{< fa fa-solid fa-handshake >}}.

I took up programming as a kid. Inspired by playing [{{< fa fa-solid fa-gamepad >}} Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us "You know what this is"), I wanted to [know how it was made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BES9EKK4Aw4 "YouTube video of the creator playing around in debug mode"). In the free time that I have, I lift weights {{< fa fa-solid fa-dumbbell>}}, watch anime {{< fa fa-solid fa-tv >}}, play basketball {{< fa fa-solid fa-basketball >}}, lerne Deutsch {{< fa fa-solid fa-beer-mug-empty >}}, and try to learn new things each day in order to improve my life, in that order (*not an exhaustive list). 

Look at my [{{< fa fa-brands fa-github-alt >}} GitHub](https://github.com/javanag), and talk to me (about anything) at [contact@javangraham.com {{< fa fa-solid fa-envelope >}}](mailto:contact@javangraham.com?subject=Howdy!&body=Hi%20Javan%2C%20your%20home%20page%20was%20so%20inspirational%20that%20I%20just%20had%20to%20reach%20out.). While you're here, check out what I [{{< fa fa-solid fa-pencil >}} write]({{< ref "/posts" >}} "You will learn a lot, I promise") and what I [{{< fa fa-solid fa-hammer >}} make]({{< ref "/projects" >}} "Hint: it won't be food").
