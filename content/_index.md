<h1>Howdy, I'm <strong>Javan</strong> and I am <span id="motd-article">a&nbsp;</span><br id="motd-break"><strong id="motd">software developer</strong>.</h1><br>

<script src="/js/motd.js"></script> 

Recently, I've been taking some time away from the industry to focus on learning some new topics, further developing my other interests, and handling some personal matters. Until late fall, I was working as a software developer in the [{{< fa fa-solid fa-truck >}} logistics](https://www.flexport.com/products/trucking/) domain. Before that, I completed a few internships at fintech, networking, and ecommerce companies, along with a few brief experiences in freelance work {{< fa fa-solid fa-handshake >}}.

I took up programming as a kid. Inspired by playing [{{< fa fa-solid fa-gamepad >}} Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us "You know what this is"), I wanted to [know how it was made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BES9EKK4Aw4 "YouTube video of the creator playing around in debug mode"). To discover more about me and what I do in my free time, start clicking "software developer" above for an almost exhaustive list<noscript>... **actually, you'll need to enable JavaScript for that experience**</noscript>!

Look at my [{{< fa fa-brands fa-github-alt >}} GitHub](https://github.com/javanag), and talk to me (about anything) at [contact@javangraham.com {{< fa fa-solid fa-envelope >}}](mailto:contact@javangraham.com?subject=Howdy!&body=Hi%20Javan%2C%20your%20home%20page%20was%20so%20inspirational%20that%20I%20just%20had%20to%20reach%20out.). While you're here, check out what I [{{< fa fa-solid fa-pencil >}} write]({{< ref "/posts" >}} "You will learn a lot, I promise") and what I [{{< fa fa-solid fa-hammer >}} make]({{< ref "/projects" >}} "Hint: it won't be food").
