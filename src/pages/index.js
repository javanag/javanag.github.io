        <p>
          Howdy, I'm Javan, a student in the Computer Science Specialist program at
          the <Icon icon="fa fa-university"/> University of Toronto. Starting May 2019, after having completed my
          third year, I spent a year working as a software developer at a fintech startup as part of 
          my <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/undergraduate/pey"><Icon icon="fas fa-user-tie" /> PEY</a>.

          This summer I am taking some courses, trying my hand at contracting, and having fun with personal projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          I first got into programming as a kid by playing <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> and
          being inspired to learn how to create a game
          like that. <i>Click around to discover some easter eggs and links on the page!</i> Check out my

            Due to being on such a small team, I took the opportunity to gain broad experience by wearing many hats:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Implementing internal and client requested/demo features for main <Icon icon="fas fa-gem" /> Ruby on Rails web application, with a <Icon icon="fab fa-react" /> React front end, feeding from a <Icon icon="fas fa-database" /> Postgres database, all deployed on <Icon icon="fas fa-server" /> Heroku.</li>
            <li>Built ETL applications in <Icon icon="fab fa-python" /> Python, containerized with <Icon icon="fab fa-docker" /> Docker and running as Kubernetes pods, to capture real time financial data before forwarding through <Icon icon="fab fa-aws" /> Kinesis for further processing, eventually being stored in <Icon icon="fas fa-database" /> RDS.</li>
            <li>Participated in hiring other software developer applicants by <Icon icon="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher" /> conducting interviews, <Icon icon="fas fa-tasks" /> grading online assessment submissions, and <Icon icon="fas fa-lightbulb" /> creating new assessments tailored to evaluate the desired skill sets.</li>
            <li>Other developer tasks, like writing <Icon icon="fas fa-file-alt" /> design docs, maintaining other <Icon icon="fas fa-book" /> documentation wikis, and <Icon icon="fas fa-running" /> planning sprints.</li>

            I created a static site as part of a marketing campaign for a pilot event the Rotary
            Club was hosting the night before <a href="http://www.canadaslargestribfest.com/">Canada's Largest Ribfest</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            After interpreting the club's needs for web page, I worked with the marketing team to implement the design
            using <Icon icon="fa fa-code" /> HTML, CSS and JavaScript with Bootstrap. After publishing,
            we tracked ad campaign impact on web page traffic with Google Analytics.
          </p>

          <p>
            In August, the page was <Icon icon="fas fa-eye" /> viewed by thousands of unique visitors.
            I'm glad that my first user-facing site, and first attempt at consulting-style
            work, had a chance to provide real impact.
