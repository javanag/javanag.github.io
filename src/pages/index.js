          Howdy, I'm Javan, a student in the Computer Science Specialist program at
          the <Icon icon="fa fa-university" /> University of Toronto. After completing my third year, I have been
          on <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/undergraduate/pey">PEY</a> working
          at <a href="https://www.overbond.com/"> <Icon icon="fa fa-briefcase" /> Overbond</a> since May 2019 as a
          software developer.

          After my internship I look forward to returning to school in the fall to complete my studies and graduate
          in <Icon icon="fa fa-graduation-cap" /> 2021.

            I recently started an ongoing internship here as a <Icon icon="fa fa-briefcase" /> <b>Full Stack Developer</b>.
            Responsibilities include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Implementing features for flagship <Icon icon="fas fa-gem" /> Ruby on Rails and <Icon icon="fab fa-react" /> React web app</li>
            <li>Creating applications to intake data from financial APIs into <Icon icon="fas fa-database" />  Postgres using <Icon icon="fab fa-python" /> Python</li>
            <li>Writing design docs, planning sprints, maintaining documentation and tests together with code changes</li>
          </ul>

            I got the opportunity to create a static site as part of a marketing campaign for a pilot event the Rotary
            Club was hosting the night before <a href="http://www.canadaslargestribfest.com/">Canada's Largest Ribfest</a>.
            I learned how to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Interpret club needs for web page, worked with marketing team to implement design as
              static site using <Icon icon="fa fa-code" /> HTML, CSS and JavaScript with Bootstrap
            </li>
            <li>Track ad campaign impact on web page traffic with Google Analytics</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Once published, it was <Icon icon="fas fa-eye" /> viewed by thousands of unique visitors
            during the month of August. I'm glad that my first user-facing site (and first attempt at consulting-style
            work) had a chance to provide real impact.
