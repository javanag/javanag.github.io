        I got the opportunity to create a static site as part of a marketing campaign for a pilot event the Rotary
        Club was hosting the night before <a href="http://www.canadaslargestribfest.com/">Canada's Largest Ribfest</a>.
        It was my first foray into web development, and had to figure out many things:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Interpreted client needs for web page, worked closely with marketing team to create and implement design as
          static site using <Icon icon="fa fa-code" /> HTML, CSS and JavaScript with Bootstrap
        </li>
        <li>Tracked ad campaign impact on web page traffic with Google Analytics</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Once the page was published, it was <Icon icon="fas fa-eye" /> viewed by thousands of unique visitors
        over the month of August. I'm glad that my first user-facing site (and first attempt at consulting-style work)
        was a success, and had a chance to provide real impact.
